Where should new parameter be added in the function that already has old parameter?
  We should add a new param in the last. Because if that function only uses old parameters until we want to add a new param, that's mean if every current usage only passed old parameters, we can at least give it a default value. We don't have to change all the calls.
  If we put new param in the first or other position, we have to change every single call to that function. So we should put a new param in the last.
